# geojson-node-editor
A node editor for OSM with geojson input. This project is in a very early stage: Only use it with the OSM-sandbox (https://master.apis.dev.openstreetmap.org).

The editor accepts a differential geoJSON file. This is a standard geoJSON file, with the exeption, that the tags key only contains tags whish you want to manipulate. 

It works in three stages:

## Load the GeoJSON into the browser

## Download the Data from OSM

## Upload the Changes to OSM
